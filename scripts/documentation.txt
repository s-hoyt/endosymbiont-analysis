## Contains explanations and examples of how to run the scripts I wrote for annotation/orthology analysis as a part of my senior thesis project on bacterial genome assembly and analysis. Descriptions of the purposes of the scripts are included as comments at the top of each script. 

## find_conserved.sh
Takes as input 1) path to Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv file generated by Orthofinder for just the set of reference genomes 2) path to same file type, but generated for set of references and the assembly of interest 3) the number of reference genomes (Note to self: can just grab this from the input based on number of columns)

example for Wolbachia. Using paths on mocha.

bash find_conserved.sh /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/wolbachia/orthofinder/references/Results_Jul05/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/wolbachia/orthofinder/references_strain2/Results_Jul31/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv 9

example for Carsonella

bash find_conserved.sh /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/carsonella/orthofinder/references/Results_Jul19/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/carsonella/orthofinder/references_and_cars/Results_Jul19/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv 10

There is no example for Profftella, because the concept of a conserved orthogroup was deemed meaningless; there are only 2 reference genomes so in order to be represented by at least 50% of the references an orthogroup need only be represented by one strain.

## find_unique.sh
Takes as input 1) Path to Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv file for set of references and assembly of interest 2) file of conserved orthogroups generated by conserved.sh 3) number of genomes (ref + assembly) in genecounts file (Note to self. I can just get this myself from the file input)

example for wolbachia:

bash find_unique.sh /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/wolbachia/orthofinder/references_strain2/Results_Jul31/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/wolbachia/conserved_orthogroups_s2.txt 10

example for Carsonella:

bash find_unique.sh /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/carsonella/orthofinder/references_and_cars/Results_Jul19/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/carsonella/conserved_orthogroups.txt 11

## find_unique.sh

Because there is no conserved file for profftella we have a separate script for it. However still checks how many of the reference genomes contain proteins in each orthgroup to establish whether profftella assembly has something unique. Takes as an argument the gene counts file for references and assembly.

example:

bash find_unique_proff.sh /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/profftella/orthofinder/references_and_proff/Results_Jul19/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv

## orthology_analysis.sh

Takes as arguments 1) the gene counts file for just the references 2) gene counts file for reference and assembly of interest and 3) the number of genomes including assembly of interest

example for wolbachia:

bash orthology_analysis.sh /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/wolbachia/orthofinder/references/Results_Jul05/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/wolbachia/orthofinder/references_strain2/Results_Jul31/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv 9

example for carsonella
bash orthology_analysis.sh /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/carsonella/orthofinder/references/Results_Jul19/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv /home/shh89/endosymbionts/final/carsonella/orthofinder/references_and_cars/Results_Jul19/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv 10

example for profftella:
bash orthology_analysis.sh ../profftella/orthofinder/references/Results_Jul19/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv  ../profftella/orthofinder/references_and_proff/Results_Jul19/Orthogroups.GeneCount.csv 3

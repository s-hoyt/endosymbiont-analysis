## Collection of files describing changes made to prokka files (*changes.log) and proteins identified as unique for each genome assembly. carsonella_unique_protein.txt and unique_protein_name_s*.txt contain the names of proteins unique to the carsonella and wolbachia genomes where unique is defined as being present in at most 50% of reference genomes. single_genome_s*.txt contains the orthogroups that contain proteins from just one genome - this includes the reference genomes and our assemblies. Therefore the only orthogroups with proteins included next to their IDs are proteins present in our assemblies. The other orthogroups contain proteins from one of the reference genomes.

Added 'partial' to names of following genes because they were flagged as OVERLAPPING_CDS by prokka and appear to be pieces of larger CDS:
      carsonella_dc_fl_00071
      carsonella_dc_fl_00072
      carsonella_dc_fl_00163
      carsonella_dc_fl_00164
      carsonella_dc_fl_00167
      carsonella_dc_fl_00168
      carsonella_dc_fl_00179
      carsonella_dc_fl_00180

Added 'partial' to names of following genes because they were flagged as SHORT_PROT_SEQUENCES by prokka and are significantly shorter (>20% shorter) than corresponding genes in the refernce/on NCBI:
      carsonella_dc_fl_00029
      carsonella_dc_fl_00049
      carsonella_dc_fl_00104
      carsonella_dc_fl_00164
      carsonella_dc_fl_00201

Changed name of carsonella_dc_fl_00104 from 'hypothtical protein' to 'partial ribosomal large subunit pseudouridine synthase D' based on BLAST results

Changed name of carsonella_dc_fl_00187 from 'imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase, glutamine amidotransferase subunit' to 'imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase subunit HisH' based on BLAST results after it was flagged by prokka as SUSPECT_PRODUCT_NAMES
